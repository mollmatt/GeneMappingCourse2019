## Day 1: GWAS, case/control and family-based studies

### lecture 1: Heather cordell
**General concepts**
<BR>

* GWAS case and controls - easier than family based studies. However, family may be more informative

* May use population based controls for a rare disease, instead of matched, verified controls

* Use X2 test to look for association.  

* Can also do odds ratios: OR (2|2 : 1|1), OR (1|2: 1|1)

* Can also calculate genotype relative risk

* These tests can be done by alleles instead of genotypes as well

*
